# Web Vulnerability Exploitation Lab

## Overview
This project documents the process of identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in a web application hosted in a controlled lab environment. The goal is to accumulate at least 100 points by solving various challenges presented by the application. Each challenge is assigned a difficulty rating (stars), and points are awarded based on the difficulty.

## Lab Setup
### Accessing the Web Application
- The web application is hosted on a server accessible only within the BTU network. You can connect to it either via VPN or by using the eduroam network.
- The application can be accessed through a web browser (Firefox is recommended) at the following address:



### Login and Progress
- Log in using the credentials provided via Moodle.
- **Important:** Do not delete cookies, as they are used to track your progress. Back up your progress regularly to avoid losing it.

## Task Description
- **Goal:** The goal is to find and solve challenges on the website to accumulate at least 100 points.
- **Challenges:** Each challenge has a number of stars (from 1 to 6), indicating its difficulty level. Points are awarded based on the difficulty level, as shown in the table below:

| Number of Stars | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Points          | 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 12 |

- Some challenges include tutorials, while others do not. Challenges with tutorials are generally easier, but they yield fewer points.

### Approach
1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Explore the web application to identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), etc.
2. **Exploit Vulnerabilities**: Use the identified vulnerabilities to solve the challenges and earn points.
3. **Document Progress**: Keep a record of the vulnerabilities exploited and the points accumulated.

### Example Challenges (if applicable)
- **Challenge 1:** SQL Injection in the login form.
- **Description:** Bypass login using SQL injection.
- **Solution:** Inject `1' OR '1' = '1` in the login field to bypass authentication.
- **Points:** 1

- **Challenge 2:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the comment section.
- **Description:** Inject a script to steal cookies.
- **Solution:** Inject `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` in the comment field.
- **Points:** 2

## Hints
- Try to solve the challenges with minimal external help. Researching the general concepts of web vulnerabilities is encouraged, but avoid directly searching for specific solutions to the challenges.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities. By completing the challenges, you'll gain a deeper understanding of common security flaws in web applications and how attackers can exploit them.
